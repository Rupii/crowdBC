<p>Kickstarter is an American public-benefit corporation that maintains a global crowdfunding platform focused on creativity and merchandising. This platform is used for raising funds for startup ideas. One of the major drawbacks on Kickstarter is that though many of the ideas being ventured are legit, some of them end up being fraudulent. There are many reasons for it as it is hosted from a single server, is prone to malicious activities easily, that lead to losing funds.And the funds of unsuccessful products just are not accounted for. Current crowdfunding systems perform triangular structure involving three groups of roles:
-requesters, 
-workers and
-crowdfunding system.
 The requester submits a task which is challenging for computers but easy for a human to complete through the crowdfunding system.</p>
 
<p> Hosting this application in its Blockchain version could potentially solve all of these problems and many more. For one, it is not held by a single party and all the data is public. Using cryptography, we can make the network practically unhackable. We can implement a supply chain on a much larger scale such that each and every asset is being accounted for making it completely end-to-end.</p>
